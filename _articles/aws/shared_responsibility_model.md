title: Shared Responsibility Model
---
The shared responsibility model is a model of cloud security described and implemented by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that defines which security elements a cloud provider is responsible for and which elements that provider is responsible for.

The shared responsibility model splits the security burden into two pieces: *security of the cloud* and *security in the cloud*. The cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud, while the consumer of the cloud provider is responsible for security in the cloud. This means that the cloud provider will ensure that their infrastructure that hosts their services will be secure, while the consumer is responsible for ensuring that any applications or systems built using those services are secure.
