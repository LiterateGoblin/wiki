title: AWS App Mesh
---
AWS App Mesh is a service mesh that provides application-level networking to help services communicate over several different kinds of compute infrastructure, standardizing how services communicate [^1].

App Mesh provides access to a proxy that routes any requests intended for an enmeshed service to that service. Networks sent over the mesh have their encryption and authentication standardized by App Mesh.
