title: Principle of Least Privilege
---

The principle of least privilege is a security principle that states that each actor in a secure system should be given only as many privileges to carry out their function, and no more [^1]. This can be implemented by starting an actor with no privileges, and only adding more when those are deemed essential to performing their job function. Using short-term credentials that automatically expire prevents long-term access to resources that are no longer necessary for an actor to access. Each actor may have different privileges depending on their role or function.
