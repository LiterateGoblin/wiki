title: If-then Planning
---
If-then planning is a planning strategy that aims to make abstract plans more concrete by phrasing them in a particular way.

## Technique 

If-then planning statements take the following form:

> If X happens, I will do Y.

where X is some condition that needs to occur and Y is some action that one needs to take when X is satisfied. Some examples:

> If today is Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, then I will exercise for 30 minutes at some point today.
>
> If I notice that I am being distracted by my coworkers, then I will limit the rest of the chat session to 5 minutes.

## Motivation

Heidi Grant Halvorson in "Nine Things Successful People Do Differently" claims that studies show that plans phrased this way have 3 times more likely to be successful than plans not phrased this way. The explanation given for this is that that one is more likely to notice opportunities when the condition is true and act on them if they are not always true.
