title: DRY Principle
---
The DRY principle - where DRY stands for "don't repeat yourself" - is a programming principle that states that a section of code should never be copied and pasted in order to repeat the same logic. This principle is meant to encourage programmers to create functions, procedures, or other abstractions.

## Benefits

The benefits of following the DRY principle is largely the same as creating a function, procedure or method. By re-using the same section of code, any updates to the code later are reflected in all places where the code is used at once, with no chance of a section being missed when updating the logic. Creating a procedure with a name will allow programmers reading the code in the future to understand exactly what the purpose of the procedure is, and likely what exactly its output and side effects are. Code that makes use of functions is shorter than code that duplicates logic, and would be easier to read in the future.
