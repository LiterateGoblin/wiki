title: Mental Contrasting 
---
A strategy for setting goals where one envisions successfully achieving a goal, including all the steps to get there.

## Technique 

  
The overall process for performing mental contrasting is as follows:

1. Imagine how you will feel when you achieve the goal.
2. Determine what obstacles are in the way in order to achieve the goal.

## Motivation

This technique is designed to provoke a mental state called **experiencing the necessity to act**, where one feels they must do something. In this case, envisioning obstacles to a goal may motivate someone to begin remove those obstacles as they envision them.
