title: Object-Oriented Programming
---
Object-oriented programming (often abbreviated as OOP) is a programming style where physical and logical objects are modeled in a program's execution. An object consists of two main parts: properties and methods. A property is some characteristic or data associated with the object (example: the color of an object). A method is some behavior that can be performed on the object or that the object can perform on other objects.

## Classes

All objects are instances of *classes.* A class defines the characteristics (properties and methods) that any object that is an instance of that class will have.
