title: To-go Thinking
---
To-go thinking is a goal reflection style where one imagines what obstacles remain before a goal can be achieved. It is the opposite of **to-date thinking**, where one reflects on what obstacles have already been surpassed. To-go thinking is effective for motivating the completion of goals perceived as valuable to complete, while to-date is more effective for goals where the value of completion is unclear.

## Benefits

To-go thinking has been demonstrated in studies to motivate goal completion when someone is already invested in a goal. That is, they already believe the goal to be important to fulfill because they will derive some value from its completion. University of Chicago psychologists Minjung Koo and Ayelet Fishbach report this in "Dynamics of Self-Regulation: How (Un)accomplished Goal Actions Affect Motivation". They explain that in to-go thinking awareness of the obstacles needed to surmount to achieve the goal sustains motivation. In to-date thinking one will feel a premature sense of accomplishment and begin to pursue that goal less aggressively.

This dynamic is flipped if the goal setter does not already feel that the goal is necessary to fulfill. In this case, to-go thinking decreases motivation and to-date thinking increases motivation. This is because a goal with unclear value now seems more important to a goal setter if they have put effort into it. Likewise, a goal with unclear value will seem less important to the goal setter if they apply to-go thinking to a goal, especially if they have not yet accomplished much.

For example, for a goal where the pursuer is already convinced of it's value and it's 50% complete, to-go thinking would be a more effective motivator ("The goal is 50% incomplete, I have to finish the rest"). For a goal where the value of completing the goal is unclear, to-date thinking would be equally effective ("I have already completed 50% of the goal, I might as well finish the rest").
